Also nicknamed “rose handler’s disease,” the fungus can be found in certain plants and their surrounding soil. Sporotrichosis mostly affects people who work with these products, such as: \\uf0b7 farmers \\uf0b7 florists \\uf0b7 gardeners \\uf0b7 those who work at plant nurseries \\uf0b7 those who handle bales of hay \\uf0b7 carpenters While rare and usually not life -threatening, this type of fungal infection can lead to serious complications. VIEW GALLERY1 What are the symptoms of sporotrichosis? The symptoms of sporotrichosis often start off mild within the first several weeks of exposure. You’ll experience a small bum p that can be red, pink, or purple. This bump appears at the site of exposure, usually on your arm or hand, and may or may not be painful to the touch. It can take 1 to 12 weeks Trusted Source before sporotrichosis shows any symptoms. As the infection progresses, the bump\\n\\ncan turn into an ulcer. You may have a severe rash surrounding the affected area, as well as new bumps that surface. Sometimes the rash can affect your eyes, and even cause conjunctivitis (commonly called pink eye). What causes sporotrichosis? Sporotrichosis is caused by the Sporothrix fungus. This type of fungus is prevalent in all parts of the world, but it may be more common in Central and South America. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Trusted Source the fungus may be found in rose bushes, ha y, and moss. If you handle any of these plants or their surrounding soil on a regular basis, you could be at risk for exposure to the fungus. Still, exposure doesn’t automatically mean you’ll develop a f ungal infection. Cutaneous sporotrichosis Having an o pen cut or wound on your skin can put you at risk for cutaneous sporotrichosis.This means that the fungus enters your skin. Some people become infected after getting cut by a plant containing the\\n\\nfungus — this is why rose thorns are noteworthy culprits of possible sporotrichosis.'"
